# IKEA E1757

| Model | E1757  |
| Vendor  | IKEA  |
| Description | FYRTUR roller blind |
| Supports | open, close, stop, position |
| Picture | ![IKEA E1757](../images/devices/E1757.jpg) |

## Notes


### Pairing
Long press both buttons on the blind (next to battery lid) for 5 seconds, until a white light between both buttons begins flashing.  Release the buttons and the light will turn off.
The device is now awake and ready to pair for 2 minutes.

Keep the CC2531 USB sniffer very close to the blind battery lid. When the interview process begins the light will begin flashing again. Once the white light stops flashing this should mean the pairing is successful.


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
cover:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"
    position_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    set_position_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"
    set_position_template: "{ \"position\": {{ position }} }"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.position }}"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    device_class: "battery"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.battery }}"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:signal"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
```
{% endraw %}
